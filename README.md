# Private Events

Site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

The main idea is:

- A user can create events

- A user can attend many events

- An event can be attended by many users

- Events take place at a specific date and at a location

Build with Rails using Devise gem to handle User authentication and create User model
